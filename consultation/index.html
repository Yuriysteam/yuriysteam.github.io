				</br></br><p>While working on a project happens that an interface of web service, mobile or desktop apps does not work. Or it is understandable where the interface has weak points but not clear how to solve them. Sometimes it's hard to negotiate requirements to a designer or an agency. Or you need a solution for the task without big financial losses. Or you are a designer and stuck with a client who does not understand you.</p>
				
				<p>The solution – you need an art director or a user interface designer. The issue is that it's hard to find them. To get advice from well-known designers takes a long time or lots of money. Also, them might don't even want to listen to you.</p>
				
				<p>I can help you with your task. I use clitical thinking, analyse and demand high-quality. I am doing interfaces, create working projects and my job is to find a way how to solve difficult problems.</p>
				
				
				<h2>How consultation works</h2>
				
				<h4>1. Send me an email with a description of the task based on a questionary</h4>
				<p>This is important because it helps to understand the issue and project structure. The more detailed the description will be – the better will be the consulatation.</p>
				
				<h4>2. Get the first free specific suggestion</h4>
				<p>After one week I will send a general comment about the task and a specific suggestion. You will get the advice for free and can decide if you would like to continue. If you don't like the advice – no hard feelings. If you believe that my suggestions can be beneficial – I will be glad to send a more.</p>
				
				<h2>What will you get</h2>
				<p>Suggestions can be different. Starting from an email to do nothing because everything is good. And ending up with me creating the interface in graphical format. If needed we can schedulle a Skype call.</p>
				
				<h2>The price</h2>
				<p>Unfortunately, I can't name it. Because I don't know your project and issues. The first suggestion is for free. For the next advice, you name the price and I send it. Same with third, fourth and etc. No limitations on the maximum and minimum amount of money.</p>
				
				<h2>About me </h2>
				<p>Have a look at <a href="/" target="_blank">the portfolio</a> to get an idea about projects I have been working on.</p>
				
				<h2>To start send me an email</h2>
				<p>Send me an email with your answers. By clicking the link opens the template with questions.</p>
