<p>There was an accident, she explains, involving an unfinished knife and some heavy machinery; one slip of the wrist and the metal blade, propelled skyward, came to rest in the leather of her work boot. She was ordered to her bed – a foot needs time to heal – but now, days later, it’s strapped into a sandal as she marches down a dusty stretch of Metropolitan Avenue in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. All, it seems, is well. Chelsea has been making knives for four years, a trade she adopted after helping her father, a blacksmith, recover from illness in 2010. She admits it’s a profession that surprises many who are unable to see past feminine dress and a gentle voice; those who know her, however, are aware there’s more to the story than meets the eye. She loves cars. She collects records. She sings. She’s reading a book about punk rock at the moment, because, she says, she likes rebels.

Her range of hand-crafted kitchen tools are made entirely from found materials – wood from her family’s property in Vermont; mechanics’ files; horseshoe rasps – and each piece retains evidence of a unique history. She points to a knife handle, made with wood that’s lined like a map. “Look,” she says. “You can see the seasons this tree endured.” Today, there are 18-wheelers barreling up the road as we make our way from her apartment to her workshop – a tiny plywood cube nestled in the middle of a larger shared workspace – several streets over. The sun blazes. Traffic roars. Still, the conversation continues. And Chelsea, with one foot bandaged, leads the way.</p>
