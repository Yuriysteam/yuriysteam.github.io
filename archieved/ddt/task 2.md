### **Responsibilities**

Before accepting the task I evaluate if I can make it. Issues can be different: not enough time, complex requests or luck of knowledge from my side. It’s better to day no to the client rather than ship a bad product at the end.

### **Understand the task**

Every product is solving an issue. When making the product ideal we are brining some usefulness to customer’s experience. This will not happen task was not understood.

To get to the bottom of things I am filling in the brief and ask several questions:

- What is your company doing? Why?
- What are you bringing to people? What problem are you solving?
- Who are those people? 
- What is the task you have for me? What do you want to achive?
- Why do you think it’s the best option?
