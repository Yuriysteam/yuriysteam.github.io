description: "De Stijl inspired font"
task: "create a dutch inspired typeface with constructivism geometry and shapes."
intro-text: "lijenen is a result of my love to De Stijl Dutch style and geometric constructivism shapes. The idea behind lijinen was to build a font out of -more or less- simple geometrical line elements.

lijinen comes with more than 400 glyphs supporting extended Latin and Cyrillic alphabets."
