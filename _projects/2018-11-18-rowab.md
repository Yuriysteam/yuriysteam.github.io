## Idea

Based on experience from <a href="/projects/2017-04-24-mp-world.html" target="_blank">previous projects</a> and research on competitors I proposed to build idea around digital business accounts. With all constraints, time limits and legal boundaries, we focused on a group of enterprises who are making international money transfers to contractors and partners abroad.

## Analysis  

Current digital banking account products challange their customers in three ways:

- calculation of the exchange commission,
- a fees for transactions and services,
- the number of details needed to send the transfer 

To make ROWA B Business easier we proposed simplification, a no-fee subscription business model and contemprorary approach to development.

## Product structure

In the centre of the service are business multi-currency accounts. To be beneficial for clients ROWA B has internal bank exchange rates. This means Czech enterprises who are dealing with the German market will have a better value compared to Czech domestic banks.

The most needed part of digital accounts for entrepreneur is paying partners. Banks use long forms and multi-step windows. We simplified the process to three steps.

Bank accounts, cards or internal transfers can be a payment method to the partner. We wanted for user customers to treat partners like contact in a phone book. Both companies and individuals can be a partner in ROWA B.

<span class="pshadow p1000">![](/projects_img/rowab/partners.png)</span>

A subscription-based model is the core of  ROWA B business. Each month clients have defined amount of transfers. As soon the limit excided client can request additional volume by paying directly from the account.

To help enterprises with paperwork we developed statements. The report can be customised.

Has been created a template for internal pages for registratuon, verification and setting up authintication.

To speed up the development and design process I developed a UI system for internal and external web pages. Each page is built out of components. Because of this we shipped pages and did design previews faster. This helped to spend more time on development and testing.

Rowa B will be launched in 2019.
