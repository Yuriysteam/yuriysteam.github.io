### Background

In XIXOIO I've been asked to create an idea and deliver web application for digital bank. Based on experience from <a href="/projects/2017-04-24-mp-world.html" target="_blank">previous projects</a> and research on competitors I proposed to build the product around a digital business accounts. With constraints, time limits and legal boundaries, we focused on a group of enterprises who are making international money transfers to contractors and partners abroad.

### Problem  

Current digital banking account products challenge their customers in three ways:

- calculation of the exchange commission,
- fees for transactions and services,
- the number of details needed to send the transfer

To make ROWA B Business easier we proposed simplification, a no-fee subscription business model and contemporary approach to development.

### Solution

In the centre of the service are business multi-currency accounts. To be beneficial for clients ROWA B has internal bank exchange rates. This means Czech entrepreneurs who are dealing with the German market will have cheaper transfers compared to Czech domestic banks.

The core part of digital accounts for an entrepreneur is paying partners. Banks use long forms and multi-step windows. We simplified the process to three steps.

Bank accounts, cards or internal transfers can be a payment method to the partner. We wanted for user customers to treat partners like contact in a phone book. Both companies and individuals can be a partner in ROWA B.

A subscription-based model is the core of  ROWA B business. Each month clients have defined the amount of transfers. As soon the limit excided client can request additional volume by paying directly from the account.

To help businesses with paperwork – we developed statements. Reports have customisation and filers.

For internal pages had been created a template for registration, verification and setting up authentication.

To speed up the development and design process I developed a UI system. Each page is built out of components. We were able to shipped pages and design previews two times faster. This helped to spend more time on development and testing.

Rowa B will be launched in 2019.
