description: "An open letter to TF2 developers from the community"
task: "grab attention of the game developer."
intro-text: "I like to play computer games. One of my favourites is TeamFortress 2. For the upcoming event, I have designed and help to code a small landing page in TF2 style. The page contains a message from the community about balance issue, about game mechanics and ways how to solve this. All information presented in a friendly funny and a bit crazy way. Page was noticed and mentioned by game developer Valve."

During the Meet Your Match update I proposed to community to present the open letter in the form of web page. If you not familiar with the game or characters – check <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUhOnX8qt3I" target="_black">TF2 youtube page</a>.<span>
