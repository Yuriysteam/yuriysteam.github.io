Process!

A bit new topic for me. Conducting an extensive research over the fashion industry. Understanding what people think, like, brief, eat and do.

<span class="p600">![Reetimee](/projects_img/reetimee/fashion.jpg)</span>

Going for an inspirational walk around the city. As well visiting client’s working space.

<span class="p600">![Reetimee](/projects_img/reetimee/space.jpg)</span>

Setting up brief with key points about client, target audience and content.

<span class="p600">![Reetimee](/projects_img/reetimee/brief.jpg)</span>

First round of sketches. Trying to find the good French, New York, modern looking «R». Thinking about other letters and whole logo placement. Digitalising some of «R» from sketches. No right proportions and flow so far. Trying cut alignment.

<span class="p600">![Reetimee](/projects_img/reetimee/sketch_1.jpg)</span>
<span class="p600">![Reetimee](/projects_img/reetimee/sketch_2.jpg)</span>

Getting inspired by French Art Nuevo movement and creating the first «R». Looks heavy.

<span class="p600">![Reetimee](/projects_img/reetimee/sketch_3.jpg)</span>

For the end of 2nd week caming up with 6 concepts. Analysing the work and getting suggestions form the client. Concepts should be more feminine.

<span class="p600">![Reetimee](/projects_img/reetimee/comment_1.jpg)</span>

With some idea in mind and feedback getting back to pencil, paper and thinking of more feminine letterforms. Thinking of cuts and letter placement. Cloths as well can be a part of the style.

<span class="p600">![Reetimee](/projects_img/reetimee/sketch_4.jpg)</span>

May be add some character, like «i» but from letter «R». Didn’t work that well. Trying some script solution. Looks bold. Not really connected with, what the client wants.

<span class="p600">![Reetimee](/projects_img/reetimee/sketch_5.jpg)</span>
<span class="p600">![Reetimee](/projects_img/reetimee/sketch_6.jpg)</span>

Developing more options. Trying different spacing, cut and strokes.

<span class="p600">![Reetimee](/projects_img/reetimee/d_sketch_1.jpg)</span>

Ending up with 4 new concepts. Trying to think what she might like. As well all of them look similar. Trying to push throw and come up with new ideas.

<span class="p600">![Reetimee](/projects_img/reetimee/d_sketch_2.jpg)</span>

At the same time starting working on a bird symbol for special clothes line or just as a separate logo.

<span class="p600">![Reetimee](/projects_img/reetimee/d_sketch_3.jpg)</span>

Rejecting boring proposals and coming with a new rounded logotype based on «Delicate» typeface.

<span class="p600">![Reetimee](/projects_img/reetimee/d_sketch_4.jpg)</span>

Putting things in context with client’s work. Seems that the logotype is working pretty good.

<span class="p600">![Reetimee](/projects_img/reetimee/context_1.jpg)</span>

Moving to other options. Taking previous design, fixing «M», so it does not look like a «W», making type more rounded and softer. Adding serifs.

<span class="p600">![Reetimee](/projects_img/reetimee/d_sketch_6.jpg)</span>

<span class="p600">![Reetimee](/projects_img/reetimee/context_2.jpg)</span>

Fixing details in the third proposal. Idea was to connect with loops and threads. Getting right the proportions, kerning and «M».

<span class="p600">![Reetimee](/projects_img/reetimee/d_sketch_7.jpg)</span>
<span class="p600">![Reetimee](/projects_img/reetimee/context_3.jpg)</span>

Developing one of the safe options by adding additional cuts and rounded edges.

<span class="p600">![Reetimee](/projects_img/reetimee/d_sketch_8.jpg)</span>
<span class="p600">![Reetimee](/projects_img/reetimee/context_4.jpg)</span>

Preparing the whole package and going to consult with the client. She  likes the development and first option. Later she changes her mind because of low-case.

<span class="p600">![Reetimee](/projects_img/reetimee/pre-pre.jpg)</span>

Presenting to the client. (On the side client’s comments.)

<span class="p600">![Reetimee](/projects_img/reetimee/feedback.jpg)</span>

Moving on. Throwing out all previous options thinking out new one. Trying to understand what changes I should do. Client keet saying that typography is not rounded and not soft.

Reading literature about how to build rounded type, looking a more examples. Aiming for modern serif typeface. Creating a new concept.

<span class="p600">![Reetimee](/projects_img/reetimee/d_sketch_12.jpg)</span>
<span class="p600">![Reetimee](/projects_img/reetimee/sketch_8.jpg)</span>
<span class="p600">![Reetimee](/projects_img/reetimee/il.jpg)</span>

Printing new logotype, fixing mistakes, thinking about new «M» and gaps in the letters.

<span class="p600">![Reetimee](/projects_img/reetimee/sketch_13.jpg)</span>

Letters still look unbalanced and spaces look out of place. Seeking for different forms, starting with serifs. Coming up with the idea of the cut in serif. Applying to logotype.

<span class="p600">![Reetimee](/projects_img/reetimee/sketch_17.jpg)</span>

Developing each letter, one by one. M is giving some trouble, but it started matching the rest after some development.

<span class="p600">![Reetimee](/projects_img/reetimee/letters.jpg)</span>
<span class="p600">![Reetimee](/projects_img/reetimee/letters_2.jpg)</span>

Getting the final version. Fixing kerning and small details, anchor points and white spaces.

<span class="p600">![Reetimee](/projects_img/reetimee/logo_f.jpg)</span>

Coming up with and idea for a presentation – short video presentation, where all logo reveals it self.

<span class="p600">![Reetimee](/projects_img/reetimee/af.jpg)</span>

As well developing the bird. Among to show it as a separate piece.

<span class="p600">![Reetimee](/projects_img/reetimee/birds_f.jpg)</span>

Preparing final presentation with the final logotype. As well explaining how the logo should work. Presenting it with the video.

<span class="p600">![Reetimee](/projects_img/reetimee/final_pdf.png)</span>

Thinking about safe zone around. It should be big to give the logo that luxurious feel. Also working on the final presentation and brand material.
