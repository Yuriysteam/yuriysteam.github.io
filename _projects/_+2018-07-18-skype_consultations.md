intro-text: "I like to play computer games. One of my favourites is TeamFortress 2. For the upcoming event, I have designed and help to code a small landing page in TF2 style. The page contains a message from the community about balance issue, about game mechanics and ways how to solve this. All information presented in a friendly funny and a bit crazy way. Page was noticed and mentioned by game developer Valve."
