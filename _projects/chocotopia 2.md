### Context

<span class="p-text">Chocotopia has several entertainment directions: chocolate and wax museums, chocolate courses, and candy stores. With a new Chocolate Experience Center opening soon, our client needed an update of existing web. We helped with new design and development, staff training, and preparations for the opening of the Chocolate Experience Center.</span>

<span class="p900">![chocotopia old web page](/projects_img/chocotopia/old.png)
</span>

<span class="p-text">Chocotopia is Czech-Belgian owned company with a long tradition in the chocolate industry. Aside from the chocolate shop and museum, Chocotopia also offers chocolate classes, a wax museum, and selfie studio, to many locals and tourists of Prague.</span>

<span class="p900">![chocotopia old web board](/projects_img/chocotopia/old2.png)
</span>

<span class="p-text">Company’s business is going great: the chocolate is delicious, the courses are creative, the staff is helpful, and the exhibitions are popular. However, the website was just not reflecting that. These older pages had scattered sections, confusing navigation and annoying pop ups.</span>

<span class="p-text">Together with Chocotopia’s management, we had to come up with a more effective general approach to visual communication, build a strong connection to the physical locations, and unite the different entertainment offerings of the company. </span>

### Let’s go

<span class="p-text">We started by taking the time to fully understand the client's businesses through in-depth discussion with management, in order to better plan our effort. The client had also requested for us to create a more convenient system for editing web content.</span>

- Study the business. What does the company offer, and what are its future plans?
- Study the profiles and behaviors of customers on the web and at Chocotopia venues.
- Create an overall concept for the project and gather relevant feedback.
- Development, testing, and bug fixing, on the website.
- Provide guidance and support to Chocotopia staff.

### **Study**

<span class="p-text">We visited Chocotopia’s museums and shops: documented exhibitions, their existing visual style, and scheduled meetings with stakeholders. We interviewed the head of the company to understand his vision, and spoke with managers and staff to understand how they work.</span>

<span class="p-text">We then analyzed customer metrics and statistics, as well as surveyed customers who bought tickets to Chocotopia attractions.</span>

<span class="p900">![chocotopia board](/projects_img/chocotopia/board.png)
</span>

<span class="p-text">These inputs helped us understand the gaps and issues, and eventually propose a concept to address these. On top of that, we also needed a restructured CMS module, through which Chocotopia could fill in content and make updates in the future. </span>

### **Design and Development**

<span class="p-text">With that in mind, we started with prototyping. The website flows like chocolate, while at the same time, features tiles reminiscent of a chocolate bar for different contents. The client should be able to easily edit content, and this layout contains everything within an appealing structure.</span>

<span class="p1000">![new web](/projects_img/chocotopia/newweb.png)
</span>

<span class="p-text">We started working on a paper, so that we could quickly test different hypotheses. We concentrated on Chocotopia’s future visitors by showcasing the museums, helping customers find how to get to the different locations, and explaining how the attractions work.</span>

<span class="p1000">![new web](/projects_img/chocotopia/newweb2.png)
</span>

We came up with the concept of a chocolate wave and connecting different elements to it.

<span class="p900">![new web](/projects_img/chocotopia/elements.png)
</span>

Chocolate and sweets-related imagery helped unite the different elements and convey the overall theme.

<span class="p1000">![new web](/projects_img/chocotopia/openingtimes.png)
</span>

We designed custom maps to illustrate where each of the venues are. 

<span class="p1000">![new web](/projects_img/chocotopia/buy.png)
</span>

<span class="p-text">Chocotopia had already been using a local provider for their ticket booking system, and so we helped integrate and match the styling of the booking system with that of the website. Similar adjustments were made to customer survey forms.</span>

### **Result**

<span class="p-text">We helped Chocotopia prepare for the successful grand opening of new Chocolate Experience Center. The company also received a modern and contemporary website to match their image and offerings.</span>

<span class="p-text">Our goal was not just to make web pages and design images, but also to help the client prepare for and start a new and significant chapter in the life of their business.</span>
