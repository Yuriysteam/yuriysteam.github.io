### Background

Cash money transfers is a small market with legal constraints, technical limits and riginal boundaris. I helped to make a convenient and simple to use application for cash money operators. System sends and receive transfers, shows balances and can give an insite about limits and money flows. 

### Problem

Main issues with cash money transfers are:

- heavy and slow desktop applications
- unconvenient process for input details for transfers
- slow and unresponsive interface 

We proposed web application with simplification in collecting data process and giving lightning and fast response for the interface and interactions.

### Solution

There is no main dashboard. Operators beging with typing transfer destination  for the transfer.

With selected country and city operator asks about how much a client want to send Czech Crowns. The operator can tell what will be a commision and in what currency reciver can collect transfer.  On the left summery starts to full in.

After the client chose the transfer system and a commision was calculated operator adds sender's and receiver's details. To make the process fast system stores ID, card and phone numbers so in the future the client can be verified faster.

When a client is already in the base search can find him and provide information for confiramtion.

When it's a new client operator types in or take a scan of client's documents and add a person to a system.
