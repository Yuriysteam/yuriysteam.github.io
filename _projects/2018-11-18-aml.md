<span class="p-center">Logotype is a bold word mark</span><br>

Check mark symbolises verification. A stands for A class s,ervice. There is a symmetry and connection between letter’s terminals referencing technological background and decision making.



Logo can be used in different sizes. If needed only a small icon is used.

For brand materials was created a set of dynamic backgrounds in a shape of digital wave. It is used on business cards, in presentation and in the web.

For AML services and representation was developed and icon set. A familiar check mark appears in some of them.

For services icons has a set of changeable components. It allows to build new icons fast to express new meanings and services.

All elements on a web page.

Visual style will not only help with company’s recognition among AML service providers. It also become a basis for the future physical and digital materials. 



For AML I did research about market and how company's are presented. I helped to asemble pages, made a logo and guided the team throw the process of creating identity. At the end I help with rewriting texts and points on a website.
