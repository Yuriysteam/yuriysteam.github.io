<span class="p-center">Logotype is a bold word mark</span><br>

Checkmark symbolises verification. A stands for A class service. There is balance and connection between letter’s terminals referencing technological background and decision making.

The logo can be used in different sizes. If needed only a small icon is used.

For brand materials was created a set of dynamic backgrounds in a shape of the digital wave. It is used on business cards, in presentation and in the web.

For presenting AML was developed and icon set. A familiar checkmark is hiding in icons.

For service icons have a set of changeable components. It allows building new icons fast to express new meanings and services.

All elements on a web page.

Visual style will not only help with company’s recognition among AML service providers. It also becomes a basis for the future physical and digital materials. 



For AML I did research about the market and how companies are presented. I helped to assemble pages, made a logo and guided the team throw the process of creating the identity. In the end, I help with rewriting texts and points on a website.
