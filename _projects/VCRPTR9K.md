## Idea

In Park, I brought up the idea to connect variable font and sound. Together we developed it into a web application for creating visual covers. I hope in the future album cavers will be more responsive and reflect the mood of the song. Typography is one way to go.

## Typeface â€“ FF RPTR9K

<br>We made a free brutal variable font. It supports Latin and Cyrillic and interpolates for width and weight.

## Web app

The font is a part of our service. The main magic happens in the web app. Under the hood, I connected microphone input with the typeface with the help of p5.js. The typeface will reflect sound inputs.



Creatives can inport their own cover or iven a GIF.

With the help of toolbar designers and musicans can set up the canvas for the best visual impression.
