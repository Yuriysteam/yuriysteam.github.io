## Idea

<span class="p-text">In Park, we came up with the idea to redesign manhole covers. Cover patterns based on old Slavic embroidery decorations. To make the discovery process exciting we created a web application and 3D models and visualizations.</span>

## Web app

<span class="p-text">The main magic is happening in the web app â€“ ornaments and patterns transform into colorful and modern looking covers. The final result can be downloaded as a 3D model, PNG, or checked in AR (on iOS devices).</span>

## 3D models and AR

<span class="p-text">Each manhole cover can be placed in context and tested in real life.</span>
