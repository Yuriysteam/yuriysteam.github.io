<span class="p-text">In future, there will be less car-savvy people. We will see cars as a technology  to get from point A to point B. Some people even will not have a desire to understand how to drive.  Thus car UI should be all about car related interactions. The UI needs to help you to have trust in the car and what it is doing.
