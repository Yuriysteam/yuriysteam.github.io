### Background

<span class="p-text">In XIXOIO I've been asked to create an idea and deliver a web application for digital bank. Based on experience from <a href="/projects/2017-04-24-mp-world.html" target="_blank">previous projects</a> and research on current competion I proposed to build the product around a digital business accounts. With constraints, time limits and legal boundaries, we focused on a group of enterprises who are making international money transfers to contractors and partners abroad.</span>

<span class="pshadow p1000">![](/projects_img/rowab/account.png)</span>

### Problem  

<span class="p-text">Current digital banking account products challenge their customers in three ways:</span>

- unnecessary hight exchange commissions,
- fees for transactions and services,
- the number of details needed to send the transfer

<span class="p-text">All of above points happens because when you sending transfer their several banks in the process. Each of them of them needs to take a commision and ask for details. For ROWA B Business we proposed simplification, a no-fee subscription business model and contemporary approach to development.</span>

### Solution

<span class="p-text">In the centre of the service are multi-currency accounts. To be beneficial for clients ROWA B has internal bank exchange rates. This means Czech while sending money to the German market will get the same rate banks to use to make the transaction between each other.  This makes transfers cheaper compared to Czech domestic banks.</span>

<span class="p-text">The core part of ROWA B Business is paying partners. Banks use long forms and multi-step windows. We simplified the process to three steps.</span>

<span class="pshadow p900">![](/projects_img/rowab/sending.gif)</span>

<span class="p-text">Bank accounts, cards or internal transfers can be a payment method to the partner. We proposed customers to treat partners like contact in a phone book. Both companies and individuals can be a partner in ROWA B.</span>

<span class="pshadow p1000">![](/projects_img/rowab/partners.png)</span>

<span class="p-text">Subscription business model: each month clients have defined amount of transfers. As soon the limit excided client can request additional volume by paying directly from the account.</span>

<span class="pshadow p800">![](/projects_img/rowab/pricing.png)</span>

<span class="p-text">To help businesses with paperwork we developed statements. Reports have customisation and filers.</span>

<span class="pshadow p1000">![](/projects_img/rowab/statement.png)</span>

<span class="p-text">For internal pages had been created a template for registration, verification and setting up authentication.</span>

<span class="p1000">![](/projects_img/rowab/email.jpg)</span>

<span class="p-text">To speed up the development and design process I made a UI system. Each page is built out of components. We were able to shipped pages and design previews two times faster. This helped to spend more time on development and testing.</span>
