Process!

Receiving the brief and deconstructing it. Understanding who the client is, what do they want. This project came as an open contest, so there are no strict boundaries.

Start with researching visuals. Looking at the official logo and presidency logos for other countries.

<span class="p600">![](/projects_img/visegrad/v4_logo.jpg)</span>

Looking at more V4 related logos.

<span class="p600">![](/projects_img/visegrad/v4_d_logos.jpg)</span>

A good example can be EU presidency logos.

<span class="p600">![](/projects_img/visegrad/eu_logos.jpg)</span>

Receiving the final requests. Logo must include :

- motto «V4 Trust» and «Czech Presidency of the Visegrad Group 2015/2016»
- Colours of the Corporate Identity of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
- Deadline: 12. 3. 2015


Beginning with some brainstorming about what can represent trust.

<span class="p600">![](/projects_img/visegrad/sketches_1.jpg)</span>


Exploring idea of a key, crown, simple solutions with dots and rectangle.

<span class="p600">![](/projects_img/visegrad/concept_1.jpg)</span>

In school deciding that most of them not working and over complicated. 6 and 5 are the strongest so far.
However, key handle looks like a gothic symbol. (That was a key entry point to final solution).

Continue looking for a symbol and going on inspirational research to Prague Castle, Prague’s streets, churches and museums.

<span class="p600">![](/projects_img/visegrad/windows.jpg)</span>


One of the first digital sketches during the research. Not working. More suitable for Prague’s transport department.

<span class="p600">![](/projects_img/visegrad/concept_2.jpg)</span>


What if use an old metaphor – Prague is a heart of Europe?

<span class="p600">![](/projects_img/visegrad/concept_3.jpg)</span>

Exploring the idea and start developing the logo.
V, heart of Europe, circle as the symbol of union and rose windows from gothic architecture.


Looking for the proportions and content. Previous option (1) was better. Time to apply typography.

<span class="p600">![](/projects_img/visegrad/concept_3_1.jpg)</span>

Immediately rejecting Helvetica and Futura. Because it is too much of those fonts around. Ending up with two concepts with Prima (3 and 4).

<span class="p600">![](/projects_img/visegrad/typography_choice.jpg)</span>

As soon symbol was developed and typography applied going for the stationary set. The logo must look great there as well.

Trying on identity.

<span class="p600">![](/projects_img/visegrad/identity_try.jpg)</span>

Rethinking placement of wordmark.

<span class="p600">![](/projects_img/visegrad/feedback.jpg)</span>

Deciding to use a simpler placement of the text part. Let logo do all the work. Doing a lot of print-outs to check the placement.

<span class="p600">![](/projects_img/visegrad/feedback_2.jpg)</span>

Designing a set of business cards. Vertical wins. The line under name will be removed later.


<span class="p600">![](/projects_img/visegrad/p_cards.jpg)</span>

Fixing small details, anchor points and adjusting colours. The last touch to do a stationary for the submission. Preparing print materials.

<span class="p600">![](/projects_img/visegrad/vector.jpg)</span>

Wrapping up, writing the address and sending to contest.
