description: "Fin tech brand identity and user experience"
task: "Design a brand identity and user experience for online money transfers."
intro-text: "Weezzo is a modern service to transfer money online. Main advantages are speed and different ways how you can send and receive money. For example, you may make a bank transfer that can be received in another country by cash delivered to your doorstep. Besides digital identity, I have been working on user interfaces and user experience for sending money for the web and mobile pages."
