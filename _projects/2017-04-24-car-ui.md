description: "Imagine a car UI vision for the next generation of autonomous vehicles"
task: "imagine new use-cases of how we may use autonomous vehicles"
intro-text: "In my prototype, I dreamed about how we will interact with a car in next 5 years. Today autopilot is only in the beginning of its development. 
To close the gap between today and the future I build UI which helps to communicate with the car and allows to perform basic actions. Car, in my opinion, will be your friend."

<span class="p-center">*UI of the car is aimed to let driver and passengers to feel most comfortable while experiencing a car ride.*</span>

<span class="p-text">In future, there will be less car-savvy people and more people who just use the car as a technology which helps to get you from point A to point B. Some people will not want to understand how to drive the car, but they will need to interact with it. Car UI should be all about car related interactions. The UI needs to help you to have trust in the car and what it does.

<span class="p-center">*Car of the future will let you drive it. Or if you can’t or not allowed to it has autopilot.*</span>

<span class="p-text">Interactions in future will be about autonomous driving level 4 (meaning: the car can drive itself in the city or highway where there is a marking. This will be widely spread and allowed by law. On the offroad human needs to take a wheel).<span>
	
<span class="p1000">![](/projects_img/car-ui/route-1.png)</span>
<span class="p-center">*After the route builds up, you can see how much you need to drive and what part of a trip autopilot can handle for you. *</span>
	
<span class="p-text">Personal devices will be a screen for an entertainment and allow to do work while the car is driven autonomously. We will not write e-mails or browse the web on car screen. Those are the duties will be given for phones or tablets.<span>

<span class="p-center">*As soon as you parked your car it connects to parking machine, receives fees information and automatically starts the parking.*</span>

<span class="p-center">*When you are back, car prepares a bill for you.
Pay right from the screen and you are ready to go.*</span>

<span class="p-text">Car of the future will service itself, will take care of how you go on a long ride or park in a busy city. Car of the future will not be just a machine. It becomes your robot friend.<span>
	
<span class="p1000">![](/projects_img/car-ui/service-1.png)</span>
<span class="p-center">*Notification and scheduling the service time.*</span>

<span class="p-text">For everybody will be possible to ride in the car of the future. However, to really drive one you still will need a driver’s licence. One solution will be a key, but it’s outdated. A much better option is to have your driver’s licence in your phone like a plastic card or to connect them to fingerprints. To drive you will need to be in your car with a phone or unlock the car with a touch of a finger.<span>
