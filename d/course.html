        <h2>About</h2>
<p>It might be that you read a lot of books about design, know about frameworks. Or it might be your first web and you, like we in the past, can’t  figure out how to make a great layout. Grids are not helping, columns and images placed in order but result is poor.</p>

<p>Our online course help you to build solid and working layout. We will explain layout constructions, give examples of already working solutions which are better then others. Ald also tell about modules, anchor points and how to use proximity theory.</p>
