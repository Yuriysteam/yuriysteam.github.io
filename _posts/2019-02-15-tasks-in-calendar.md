In my daily routine, I use the approach called "Clean Inbox". Each email requires some action and later will be deleted or archived. For example: when it’s a quick reply I do it on the spot. If I need to hold email I move it out to "Hold" folder. When I need to think about a reply I create a task in the calendar about that.

I used to manually create those tasks. It appeared that simple drag-and-drop of the email into the Calendar app can magically move all the data. Link to the message will be saved with the email theme.

Same approach I use for reading web articles. I drag-and-drop them and web link will be copied to the calendar. Organize and save the time.
