<span class="p1000">![Amsterdam design travel guide](/blog_img/advices/amsterdam.jpg)</span>

The issue with travel guides is lack of inspiration, design orientation and amount of crowd on popular sights. I found out that a successful design trip is a combination of beautiful places with some tech or modern approach to the design of the environment and everyday things. I am looking for technological things which makes the life of citizens better.

To find design kicks I plan where and what I’d like to see. I combined sports, good coffee places and museums.

Last update – 6th of March 2019. Check guides for [Helsinki](http://yuriy.eu/design/2019/03/07/helsinki-design-guide.html) and [Prague](/design/2019/03/18/prague-design-guide.html). 

### Museums

[Stedelijk Museum of modern art](https://www.stedelijk.nl/en) The permanent exhibition is ok. Have a collection of DeStijl art and architecture. The March display I saw was good too. Adult ticket €18.5

[Moco museum of modern art](https://mocomuseum.com/) Moco is a small museum in a traditional Dutch house. Exhibitions are great. Better buy the ticket before the visit because of the line. There are discounts.

[Amsterdam Public library](https://www.oba.nl/oba/english.html) The library is free to enter. Free Wi-Fi. On the top floor, there are great cheap food and coffee. In addition, an amazing view of the city. Interiors and sitting spots are great too.

### Transport

Metro stations worth visiting: Noord, Noorderpark, Centraal Station, Rokin, Vijzelgracht, De Pijp and Europaplei.<br>The two-hour ticket should cover visiting all of them with talking pictures. Around €7 total.

Take a free ferry to Noord part of Amsterdam. A ferry departs from Centraal station. Visit NDSM. It's an old shipyard turned into the creative district. 

### Food

[Cafe George](http://www.cafegeorge.nl/george-amsterdam) (Leidsegracht 84) Opens at 11:00 and excellent for a late breakfast. Coffee is good. French food is tasty. Free Wi-Fi and outside sitting with a view on a canal.

[Fou Fow Ramen](https://foufow.nl) (Elandsgracht 2A) Amazing and nourishing tiny Japanese restaurant. Portions are big, noodles are tasty and dumplings are delicious. All is cooked by Japanese folks. Free Wi-Fi. The place is popular among locals so expect a line during lunch and dinner. Price for regular ramen €14.

[Pancakes! Amsterdam](https://pancakes.amsterdam) A chain of Amsterdam pancake places. I was in two located in Centraal and Berenstraat 38. Pancakes are tasty and suit well to start the day. Breakfast from 3 pancakes and coffee around €14.

[Pllek restaurant](http://www.pllek.nl) (tt. Neveritaweg 59) Near NDSM ferry station, open fireplace, tasty food and soups. Cosy space made out of industrial ship containers. Noise level is super comfortable.

[Buffet van Odette](https://english.buffet-amsterdam.nl/english/#menu) (Prinsengracht 598) Stylish, expensive and classy buffet. Good for breakfast. €18. View on a canal and interior are cool. To show off :)

[Soup en Zo](https://soupenzo.nl)  (Jodenbreestraat 94) Tasty, cheap soups and bakery. A tiny place with bar stools and big windows. Soups from €5,50. There are two other places in the city. Different locations have different menus.

[Sandwiches t KUYLTJE](http://kuyltje.nl) (Gasthuismolensteeg 9) Big and tasty sandwiches.

Schipol airport has a democratic prices in restraints. A proper dinner for €12.

### Locations and places

[Oostelijke Eilanden](https://www.iamsterdam.com/en/about-amsterdam/amsterdam-neighbourhoods/oostelijke-eilanden) A district on a north part of Amsterdam. Modern architecture and bridges. A district around Python bridge has modern houses for locals with amazing views. 

[NDSM](https://www.iamsterdam.com/en/about-amsterdam/amsterdam-neighbourhoods/ndsm) An old shipyard turned creative district. Right near the ferry station, there is a Russian submarine. Legend says that Dutch bought it for €1 in St. Petersburg, brought it to Amsterdam and run out of money.

Jordaan – district is less touristic and has amazing old 17th-century houses.
