Thinking about the increase of bike and scooter sharing services, I decided to [design an experience](/desing/2019/04/12/scooter-sharing-app.html) for micro mobility ride sharing on wearables. I have been thinking about the whole experience of renting a scooter. Customer goes throw a set of decisions, which leads to whether abandoning the rent or being a happy client.

To make a decision about renting a scooter client needs to know:

- Where is the vehicle?
- Does it have a battery?
- Does the scooter damage?
- Will it last to my destination?
- Where is it in a pile of other scooters?
- Can I reserve it?
- How to unlock? Where is the code?
- How much will I be charged?

All of those plays important part in decision making process and overlall experince from a ride.

### Vehicle location and unlock

Unlock with NFC

[another UI on the watch]

### Charge on a different level

You have to scan each vehicle to see the rejection notice. To wit, if you come across a cluster of 5 dead scooters, you get 5 unavailable messages. There aren’t any prominent visual indicators on the vehicles to let you know they’re out of commission

No display on the scooter itself [because speed zone map will help to limit the speed and charge level is shown oin the app or by stripe. No need to have aditioanl screen]

### Integration with maps

Integration with Maps services to find the right scooter [UI of Google maps with directions and scooter]
