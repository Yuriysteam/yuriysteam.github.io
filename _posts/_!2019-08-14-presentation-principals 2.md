**Rule:** Design presentation happens always personally and using the proper format for the design.

Show web sites right in a browser. The mobile screens go to the mobile phone and give your client a phone instead of a computer. If it’s an app, show the mockup in Marvel or inVision.

Brochures, magazines and business cards must be printed. 3D print logotypes and put illustrations in context with other work. Any video or audio should be playable in the prototype.

When you are going to show your design imagine where clients will use it and show it respectively.

Make sure that design is accessible to the client after the meeting. Give a link to preview or leave your printed material. Taking money before the start of the project should help with trust.

## **How to break the rule**

Sometimes the competition is good and you have to surprise the client with an unexpected approach. Instead of showing work – emphasize an aspect. 

1. To show volume – make a big print out of design. Effect of a huge roll of paper sometimes greater than showing a picture on a screen. You working not only with visual communication and also with sound and kinesthetic design.
2. To show change – show the old version and new design. Slowly reveal how the design changed.
3. Add music. Using hearing with visual scores additional points for your presentation. We won a tender like this. 

If you know different ways how to break the rule, please share with me.
