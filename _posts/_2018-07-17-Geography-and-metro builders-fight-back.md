Last week I was breaking a traditional layout for the Prague metro. This week I started by adding a future D line. Then shameful happened. In 2020 in plans to connect A and B on Zličin. 

In the past capital wanted to continue A line to Prague’s airport. However, taxi drivers were against it. Prague changed its mind and now we have a strange turn at the east end of the green line. Instead of the airport, we’ve got the hospital. Close.

In 2017 Ilya Birman [issued a wonderful map](https://ilyabirman.ru/projects/minsk-metro/) of Minsk with detailed centre and goal for other cities to envy. Tourists of Prague deserve nothing less.

Making a centre bigger and putting main tourist sights. I was always wondering why the official map does not explain how to get to Prague Castle or Charles bridge. Both places don’t have a lack of visitors, but still. 

Returning A and B lines back to their geographical place. As for the west ends – they can be abstract.

Enlarging line names. Everything outside of the circle can be geographically inaccurate.

Adding valuable information on how to buy tickets, use bikes and when metro works. This is what tourists are asking on forums a lot.

Instead of “Prague metro for tourist” adjusting to a simple “Prague metro”. This is the alternative version of the Prague map v0.0.5
