<span class="p1000">![Helsinki design travel guide](/blog_img/advices/helsinki.jpg)</span>

The issue with travel guides is lack of inspiration, design orientation and amount of crowd on popular sights. I found out that a successful design trip is a combination of beautiful places, modern technology and being in well thought environment and small everyday things. 

To find design kicks I plan where and what I’d like to see. I combined spots, good coffee places and museums.

Last update – 7th of March 2019. Check guides for [Amsterdam](/design/2019/03/06/amsterdam-design-guide.html), [Tokyo](/design/2019/12/10/tokyo-design-guide.html) and [Prague](/design/2019/03/18/prague-design-guide.html). 

### Museums

[Kiasma Museum of modern art](https://kiasma.fi/en/) Definitely the best in the city. All the times I’ve been the show was great, idea inspiring and astonishing. Ticket €15. First Friday of the month is free. And the building is awesome too.

[Amos Rex museum](https://amosrex.fi/en/) The building is stunning. €18

[Helsinki Design museum](http://www.designmuseum.fi/en/) Showcasing Finnish industrial and graphic design. The exhibition is not big but with a good sense of humour and positive attitude.

### Transport

All West metro stations: Matinkylä, Niittykumpu, Urheilupuisto, Tapiola, Aalto University, Keilaniemi. Also worth visiting Kamppi and Central Railway Station. University of Helsinki entrance looks like a cave! At last on Vuosaari there is a cool metro bridge.<br>The two-hour ticket should cover visiting all of them with taking pictures.

### Food

[Sis. Deli + Café](https://sisdeli.fi) (Kalevankatu 4) Breakfast with porridge pot and coffee is great. Small, cosy and authentic. Interior is a mix of industrial and Scandinavian.

[Story](https://www.restaurantstory.fi/kortteli) (Urho Kekkosenkatu 1, 5 flour) Panorama on the central square of the city from Kamppi. Coffee was tasty. Porridge included. Go there for view. Porridge + coffee breakfast from 11€.

### Locations and places

Eira – modern expensive houses near the sea shore. A pleasant park and lack of tourists.
