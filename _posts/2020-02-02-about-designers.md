The issues with modern designers that they like to move pixels and style them. Not everyone of course, but some treat design only as a stylistic discipline. Currently, there is a neomorphism train rushing ahead. However, does it worth your time?

This is a classic Gmail look. List of mails, sidebar, navigation and buttons:

<img src="/assets/images/lazy.png" alt="neomorphism" data-echo="/blog_img/advices/gmail_classic.png">

Next, a new look. Red compose button got bigger, stylish navigation and chat:

And a neomorphism UI by [Khushboo Choudhary](https://dribbble.com/khushary). It looks modern and hip.

There are no changes to how Gmail functioning and how clients' read and write emails. I believe stylistic changes does not deserve time we spend on them. Changing a style will not significantly affect how the product brings benefits to the customer.

A new colour for buttons will bring less customer compared to the integration with Apple Pay, for example.

A new style is only showing off and adding a value to the service. The new design is beneficial, helpful to customers and solve problems.
