<span class="p1000">![Amsterdam design travel guide](/blog_img/advices/amsterdam.jpg)</span>

The issue with travel guides is lack of inspiration, design orientation and amount of crowd on popular sights. I found out that a successful design trip is a combination of beautiful places with some tech or modern approach to the design of the environment and everyday things. I am looking for technological things which makes the life of citizens better.

To find design kicks I plan where and what I’d like to see. I combined sports, good coffee places and museums.

Last update – 6th of Jun 2019. Check guides for [Helsinki](/design/2019/03/07/helsinki-design-guide.html), [Amsterdam](/design/2019/03/06/amsterdam-design-guide.html) and [Prague](/design/2019/03/18/prague-design-guide.html).

### Locations and places

[Oostelijke Eilanden](https://www.iamsterdam.com/en/about-amsterdam/amsterdam-neighbourhoods/oostelijke-eilanden) A district on a north part of Amsterdam. Modern architecture and bridges. A district around Python bridge has modern houses for locals with amazing views. 

[NDSM](https://www.iamsterdam.com/en/about-amsterdam/amsterdam-neighbourhoods/ndsm) An old shipyard turned creative district. Right near the ferry station, there is a Russian submarine. Legend says that Dutch bought it for €1 in St. Petersburg, brought it to Amsterdam and run out of money.

Jordaan – district is less touristic and has amazing old 17th-century houses.
