In March, I have been to Amsterdam and Vienna, discovered new art and found Japanese pop-rock and classical artists. The collection is an energetic mix to kick off the beginning of the spring.

Apple keynote brought *Love – Unloved* from intro. And the Amsterdam trip brought up the energetic story in *Amsterdam – Jaya The Cat*. With the track, I started the flight.

Amazingly emerging Saigmaster and Walsh show “Beauty” featured a room with deep *Heart – Darkside*. If you have good speakers and a dark room this is the best option to listen to it. Almost put in a trance and enjoyment.

[Enjoy the collection](https://open.spotify.com/user/yuriysteam/playlist/0IFV7lB9iYvDQlfnlyXznF?si=NnTqLOFgS5KMmknQ_ArbLQ) on Spotify. Suitable for a commute or travelling on foot. For Apple Music use [Convertify](https://haydenhong.com/convertify/) to get the playlist.
