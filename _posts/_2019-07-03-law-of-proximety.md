On a new job I noticed that designers and developers are not aware. of prixmity in layout. This resulted is poor layout design and luck of customer satisfaction.

My goal is to help developers and designers to earn more by making work better.  Applying the law of proximity can help with layout and understanding designers.

## **Law: Objects that are close to each other, tend to be persived as connected**

Designers work with text, images, headlines and other placed on a screen. Web developers transform those objects into tags: div, img, h1, sections, paragraphs and etc. This is basic of layout creating. Next step is to get logical hierarchy or naration.
