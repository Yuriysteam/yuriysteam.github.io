I have been living in Prague for 4 years and love the city. I love urban areas for modern and old architecture. I love for smart approach to space organisation. And my most favourite is the metro. 

I use it every day. Last year I became dissatisfied with the current map.  It is cluttered, stations made ot of circles like chains and lines shapes look strange. For tourists map is hard to use. For instance, it does not provide directions on how to get to Charles Bridge or to Prague castle.

I want to make the map better. And I want to make it better for Prague's guests.

The main challenge is the central triangle. There is a railways station as well there. I did several iterations before coming up with a curved C line solution.

Differences to current map:

- bigger name size
- clear railway station names
- clear airport transfers
- Prague castle tram transfer



Next to do a lot of print tests in different sizes and drew icons for main touristic objects. Feel free to send me a comment by <a href="mailto:yuriysteam@icloud.com" target="_top">mail</a> or on <a href="https://t.me/yuriysteam">Telegram</a>.
