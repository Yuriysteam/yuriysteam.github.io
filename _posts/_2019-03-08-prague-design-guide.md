<span class="p1000">![Helsinki design travel guide](/blog_img/advices/prague.jpg)</span>

The issue with travel guides is lack of inspiration, design orientation and amount of crowd on popular sights. I found out that a successful design trip is a combination of beautiful places with some tech or modern approach to the design of the environment and everyday things. I am looking for technological things which makes the life of citizens better.

To find design kicks I plan where and what I’d like to see. I combined sports, good coffee places and museums.

Last update – 9th of March 2019.

### Museums

[DOX Museum of Modern art](https://www.dox.cz/en/) For sure first place to visit. Buidling is awesome. There is a huge zepplin on the top. Exhebitions are usualy interesting. The best option to get there by metro and then walk. Adult €8.

[Kamppa Museum](http://www.museumkampa.cz/en/) In the center of the city. Having contemprorary art from Czech artists and designers. Has a nice look out on the river and Charls bridge. Don't miss pinguins near the river. €12.

### Transport

Metro stations are mostly boring. With checking: Náměstí Republiky, Andel, Rajská zahrada and Střížkov.<br>The one-hour ticket should cover visiting all of them with talking pictures. €1.25



### Food



### Locations and places

Eira – modern expensive hoses near the sea shore. A pleasant park and lack of tourists.
