These recommendations for playing in docked mode with joy-cone grip. I have been trying to get as close as possible to Splatoon 2 feeling.

For playing in tabletop mode with joy-con grip increase gyro Yaw-axis to 16. For playing in handheld mode increase gyro Yaw-axis to 20 and maybe aim assist.

P.S. Even with this setting aiming is a bit wobbly and lose. Sticks are too sensitive. The game looks impressive when running in handheld mode: a toy Overwatch on the Switch. In docked mode it's clearly visiable that this is a port.
