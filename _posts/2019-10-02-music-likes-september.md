August was busy and good for oldies and road trips. I was in [Krakow](https://www.icloud.com/sharedalbum/#B0FG3KxPyGswFfq) and finished several projects.  The most memorable are *Mara Bells*, *Call me by Blondie*, and *The Futureheads.*

[Enjoy the collection](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/36eG1x8ScfXrMwdIUo78hZ?si=ErXDo9c9QOa16NioJAP4Vw) on Spotify. Suitable for a commute or travelling onÂ foot. For Apple Music use [Convertify](https://haydenhong.com/convertify/) to get the playlist.
