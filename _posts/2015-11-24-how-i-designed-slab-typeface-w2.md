Week two started with editing and reviewing the material from week one. I had sketches and idea in my mind. As well, I had some raw shapes of glyphs made in Illustrator. Time to add new characters.

Print out of the outcome from week two. Some kerning applied. Why print letters, while you make a type? Characters on screen might look good enough, but on paper you immediately see all imperfections and mistakes. Strokes, which are too think appear to be darker, too thin – appear almost invisible. The whole line of letters is jumping and an eye is moving with this small jumps from one glyph to another. In the good type, sight is moving with the same speed across all characters.

One by one, letters look good and interesting. But, and this is the issue of  the type on early stages, together they do not create a harmonious typographic pattern. Though, I was trying to mimic the similar feature (a straight line and then curve bowls), in some cases it just doesn't work. For instance, “b” and “d” can't follow this rule. The print outs can clearly evidence that.

With a pencil, I am highlighting the weak spots. The “a” terminal is too dark, heavy and sticking out of the letter. “d” and “b” have a small strange serif on a base line. As for bowls, they give an interesting image of opening doors. This definitely will be fixed in future. As for “s” and “o”, they look like as refugees in this typeface, because the “o” is too thing (and does not sit on a base line), and “s” should have lighter strokes in counters and more curvy shape. Specking of strokes, later I will come to an understanding, which letters should have the strokes, but for now I was using just a one weight line to outline the shape of glyphs.

You can clearly see, the thickness of strokes in this “a”. With arrows, I was outlining my perspective, where to make strokes thinner. However, it's actually quite opposite.

If we compare some slab typefaces, where there is a contrast between thicks and thinks, the main  principal is: thick bowl stroke and thick vertical steam stroke. The thickness of steam can be proportionally big from the first sight, but in future this will help letter to match the rest of characters.

>A tip: when in doubt about how to start drawing a letter, refer to another similar typeface.

Next issue I had, was different serifs (size, shape and direction) in ascender and steams. For instance, the ascender serif for “d” supposed to  go from left to right. This is due to the fact that we used to write from left to right. So the line starts in top left and ends in bottom right part of the letter. (You can see similar shape at the bottom of the sheet).

With all of that, I am moving to the third week and will talk more about slabs in general and thinks and thins.
