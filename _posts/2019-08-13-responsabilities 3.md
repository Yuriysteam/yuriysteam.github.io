No manager or boss is going to plan weekends, holidays and vacations for you. No colleagues or supervisors schedule breaks or pauses. It’s on you.
We are on a long marathon and being in shape guarantees better results. With a personal open schedule and increased responsibility, people tend to overwork and spend less time on themselves. The result – drained and unhappy workaholics.

When planning, I, first thing, put pauses and food breaks in the calendar. I know that there will be a pause and it allows me to stay concentrated. Concentration vanishes in 20 to 30 min and I have a break to counter that. Time is limited and the brain works better solving harder tasks.

As a responsible professional with an open schedule plan breaks first. Then — work.
