Being a [controversial topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt1Pcb2cnEw), increase of bike and scooter sharing services becomes a trend of recent years. I designed an experience for micro mobility ride sharing on wearables.

<span class="p1000">![Apple Watch Scooter Sharing App](/projects_img/scooter/intro.jpg)</span>

I set a limit for the design: no changes to scooter’s construction and the watch app is an addition to the phone. Watch should cover quick unlock, search and ride. The phone is needed for on-boarding, payment set up or issue reporting.

To make a decision about renting a scooter client needs to know:

- Where is the vehicle?
- Does it have a battery?
- Does the scooter damaged? 
- Will it last to my destination?

Watch app can provide answers to those questions in the compact, convenient and understandable form. I defined two scenarios which can benefit from using a watch:

- client already in front of a scooter(s),
- client needs to search for nearby vehicles sutable for a ride.

### In front of a scooter

Scooter is in front of you. Unlock and go. Currently, services use a QR or digit code to identify and unlock vehicles. Geopositioning and mobile internet help to verify if the client really near the vehicle.

Watch is about quick interactions. One screen helps to make decision about renting based on amount of battery charge.

### Find a scooter suitable for a ride

If there are no scooters in close proximity (let’s say 10 meters), watch can help to locate vehicles in walkable distance. Search gives a list of scooters with charge and distance to them. In case all near by scooters have low battery, search is always  accessible afrer scooter cards.

### What next?

This user experience can be applied for shared bikes, scooters, e-scooters, mopeds or cars.

Speed is valuable for unlocking, finding the right vehicle and getting to the desired destination. The idea of supporting a watch app might be expensive right now. I believe with time, watch can help companies to differentiate from the competition and provide a smoother and enjoyable experience.

Micro-mobility gaining popularity because it’s faster than car-based trips. Sometimes even faster public transportation. In my opinion scooters and bikes will not change transportation in the cities, but will be a solid addition to current means. To have a better experince in the future I [propose a set of ideas](/desing/2019/04/16/ux-micro-mobility.html) for scooters and sharing services.
