Besides being active or sitting in front of the computer humans eat. A lot. And to track what you had is hard. There are smart forks, sensors and apps: they require manual input. There is no same magic like seeing trasaction on a phone or calories burned.

When I am not cooking at home, I order a lunch box or go to canteen. Food box providers and canteens already have all food data. Why not to share it?

### Unite food tracking with lunch boxes and canteens

Excluding cases when a doctor has to guide the patient, I am talking about people with desire to have a healthier life.

A potential customer of the service look for a canteen or lunch box service, which provides food data. Add data is tracked in the Health.app. Maps can show restaurants providing food data.

As soon as the place has been found the client have information about menu, portions, carb, calories, fats and etc. Menu and portons sugessions are based on lifestyle, sports goals and allergies.

When a client buys food via the app or pays on a cash desk, food data immediately transferred to the phone. If a person didn’t finish the meal or it was not tasty – it can be removed from the list.

At the end of the week data combined into report about how the progress of being healthy goes. Companies can not only sell food and also sell data about the food.
