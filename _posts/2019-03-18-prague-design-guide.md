<span class="p1000">![Prague design travel guide](/blog_img/advices/prague.jpg)</span>

The issue with travel guides is lack of inspiration, design orientation and amount of crowd on popular sights. I found out that a successful design trip is a combination of beautiful places with some tech or modern approach to the design of the environment and everyday things. I am looking for technological things which makes the life of citizens better.

To find design kicks I plan where and what I’d like to see. I combined sports, good coffee places and museums.

Last update – 18th of March 2019. Check guids for [Amsterdam](http://yuriy.eu/design/2019/03/06/amsterdam-design-guide.html) and [Helsinki](http://yuriy.eu/design/2019/03/07/helsinki-design-guide.html). 

### Museums

[DOX Museum of Modern art](https://www.dox.cz/en/) For sure the first place to visit. The building is awesome. There is a huge zeppelin on the top. Exhibitions are usually exciting. The best option to get there by metro and then walk. Adult €8. Quite good coffee place.

[Kamppa MuseumLocated in the city centre. Having contemporary art from Czech artists and designers. Has a nice look out on the river and Charles bridge. Don't miss the penguins near the river. €12.

[Prague City Gallery (GHMP)](http://en.ghmp.cz) Gallery with several contemporary art exhibitions. Located in several places: The Stone Bell House, Municipal Library, Colloredo-Mansfeld Palace, House of Photography, Villa Bílek, Troja Château and František Bílek’s House in Chýnov. Pick an exhibition from the website and visit a location. €5 per building.

[Národní galerie](https://www.ngprague.cz/en/) Also spread across several locations. Has a permanent exhibition of Czech artist and cubists. Also has changing exhibition of contemporary art. €6 per building.

[Galerie Rudolfinum](http://www.galerierudolfinum.cz/en/) Sometimes running exhibitions of modern and contemporary art. Also showcasing photography and installations. For now, admission is free. 

### Transport

Metro stations are mostly boring. Worth checking: Náměstí Republiky, Andel, Rajská zahrada and Střížkov.<br>The one-hour ticket should cover visiting all of them with talking pictures. €1.25

During summer across the Vltava river goes ferries. Can be used with regular transport tiket.
