With modern technology, humans can track movements and activity harmlessly. Put on a smartwatch and check a report in the app. Sleep tracking, calories, noise level and time spent doing the exercise: all this data helps with making better health decisions.

Besides doing sports or being active humans eat a lot. And to eat healthily can be hard. Especially track the food consumed. There are smart forks, sensors and etc. But they still require manual input. And they not precise.

I noticed when I am not cooking at home, I order a lunch box or go to canteen. Food box providers and canteens already have all food data for healthy food reporting.

Unite food tracking for diet boxes and canteens

I am not talking for serious cases where doctors have to guide patients, but rather simpler one, where people want to live a healthier life. 

A potential customer of the service opens up an app, look on a map for a canteen which provides data for Health.app.

As soon as the place has been found the client can have look information about menu, portions, carb, calories, fats and etc. Here might come suggestions based on lifestyle, sports goals or allergies.

When a client buys food via the app or pays on a cash desk, food data immediately transferred to the phone of the owner. If a person didn’t finish the meal or it was not tasty – it can be removed from the list.

At the end of the week, it would be nice to combine data from activity, weight and food to give a report about how the progress of being healthy goes. 

Companies can not only sell food and also sell data about this food for eaters.
