Don’t say “I told you so”. Be polite.

This literaly leads you to nowhere. The reson is: those, who remembered, next time will pay attention to your comments. It’s a win. And they will appreciate your politeness and attention. Next big win.

Those who didn’t remember might step on a same rake again. Nothing you can do. And reminding them will make them angry.
