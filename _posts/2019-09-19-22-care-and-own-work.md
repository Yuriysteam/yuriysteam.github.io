I have a principal: I work on a project as I own it. Fully. The project is mine starting from people and finishing with its performance after launch. I know people who are doing work for a time which mentioned in the contract or take responsibility for a specific part of of the project. However, for me, itâ€™s hard to work this way.

It does not mean that I will do work for other people or tell them what to do. There are a lot of unforeseen and unpredictable variables in the work process. Thus, I try to know as much as I can and broad my area of responsibility. 

For the [corporate banking project](https://yuriy.eu/projects/rowab-business.html), I was asked to only produce the user interface. But, I thought about development and management and helped to deliver the design system.

I take each project as if I do it for myself and will be using it after.
