Approach. No interface is the best interface. 

Internet banking now integrated into our current live behaviour. With online banks we are managing personal and finances, taking for loans or buying insurance and sending transfers. The best system is the one which does not exist but the function is there and can be executed. Banks are working on the powerful motivation. Need: I need money for something and feat: I don’t want to lose money. Client’s don’t want to learn about complicated banking internal operations, terminology and how the system works.

Clients have need to earn money, store money, send money or spend money for needed services. Banks can predict and provide those services also education clients about how to save and earn money.  Banking providing services is a reality. What if bank will be integrated even further into our life. It can tell where you can save money: calculate analytics and give an explanation where money went. Where you can earn money: investments, funds and loans. Take credit on the go at the moment when you need it: buying new car. Question about credit can be asked to you phone and given live.
