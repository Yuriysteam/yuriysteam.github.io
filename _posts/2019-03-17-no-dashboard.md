I think in the future there will be no privacy at all. For instance, modern insurance tracks when clients leave the country and turn foreign health insurance automatically. Integration between services will be easier and fintech, insurance and health care will follow eventually. This means there will be less UI.

<span class="p900">![no dashboard](/blog_img/advices/nodashboard.jpg)</span>

There will be no need for the dashboard in banking services. Contextual suggestions will be the best option to sell services.

While buying the new Tesla in the online shop, banking startup can suggest a loan knowing your spending habits, history and credit history.

For dishonest stores, fintech automatically issue a one-time prepaid card to make a purchase. All these done in the background without bothering the client.

Tax report for the last month should just go automatically. With all calculations, form filling and such.

No dashboard. No UI. No complications.
