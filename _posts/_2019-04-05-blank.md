In March, I have been to Amsterdam and Vienna, discovered new art and found Japanese pop-rock and classical artists. The collection is an energetic mix to kick off the beginning of the spring.

Apple keynote brought *Love – Unloved* from into. And the Amsterdam trip brought up the energetic story in *Amsterdam – Jaya The Cat*. With the track, I started the flight.
