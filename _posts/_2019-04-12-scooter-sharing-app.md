Thinking about the increase of bike and scooter sharing services, I decided to design an experience for micro mobility ride sharing on wearables.

<span class="p1000">![Apple Watch Scooter Sharing App](/projects_img/scooter/intro.jpg)</span>

I set a limit for the design: no changes to scooter’s construction. Watch app is an addition to the phone. The watch can be useful for quick unlock, search and ride. On-boarding, payment set up or issue reporting are better to do on the phone.

To make a decision about renting a scooter client needs to know:

- Where is the vehicle?
- Does it have a battery?
- Does the scooter damaged? 
- Will it last to my destination?

Watch app should provide answers to all those questions in the compact, convenient and understandable form. If the scooter is damaged or hidden somewhere – watch might be a bad option to look for it. I defined two scenarios which can benefit from using a watch:

- client already in front of a scooter(s),
- client needs to search for near by vehicle sutable for a ride.

### In front of a scooter

Scooter is in front of you. Unlock and go. Currently, services use a QR or digit code to identify and unlock vehicles. Geopositioning and mobile internet help to verify if the client really near the vehicle.

Watch is about quick interactions. One screen helps to make decision about renting based on amount of battery charge.

### Find a scooter sutable for a ride

If there are no scooters in close proximity (let’s say 10 meters), watch can help to locate close distance scooters. Search will give a list of vehicles with charge and distance to them. In case all near by scooters have low charge, search is always  accessible afrer scooter cards.

### Insted of conclusion

This user experience can be used for shared bikes, scooters, e-scooters, mopeds or cars.

Watch is a convenient helper to make quick unlock and rentals of scooters. With current set up watch already allows choosing scooters by battery charge, location and status. With design in mind, micro mobility sharing experience can be pushed even further. I [propose a set of ideas](/desing/2019/04/12/ux-for-micro-mobility.html) for the next iteration of scooter sharing services.
