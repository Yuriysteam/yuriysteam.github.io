I have a principle: Instead of criticising — fix it. Criticising can be helpful when people asked for it. I know designers and developers who can improve the work of others by writing or talking criticism. However, I don’t believe that there will be a significant change because of critique. People need a direction or solution on how to improve service or their work. If I know the way – I am happy to share it.
