There are two traditional ways to finding an answer to questions: ask people with knowledge or search for more info in the web, books, movies and etc. But how to deal with questions about yourself?

Relativies or friends can provide an answer to some of questions. Books can share experince from author which can be related to yourself. Still all answers are inside. The trick is to dig them. Of course with greater knowledge – it's possible dig dipper. However, it's not always needed. 

Phsycologists is using the same approach – the client is finding the answer inside. Phsycologists helps to ask right questions and build the chain of thoughts. Same can be done with an email to a person.

Here is and example. Nikolay Toverovsky published a thout that it's bad to sit on knowledge. I got interested that how it could be – no reason to just publish any knowledge. So I strat writing an email: 

> Hello, Nikolay.
>
> I read your post and didn't understand you idea that it sucks to sit on knowldge and not share them?

But it's still not clear why this is important? Adding the bit about that there are a lot of knowledge.

> Contradiction in my head that there are a lot of knowlge. Web, books, videos and only lazy don't post in instagram advices about how to live better. Choose what you want. What is the reason to share more?

Hm... What can be an answer to this question? 

> Most valuable knowledge are the one which solve the problem. Basing on this characteristics it's helful to choose what to publish.  

Ok, publish knowgle to solve problems of others.
