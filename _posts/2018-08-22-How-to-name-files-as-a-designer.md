For 7 years in design, I worked on different design projects. Some were easy and straightforward. Some had twisting bumpy turns and last minute changes which lead to a mess in my files and organisation. During those years I found a small trick on how to stay organized with my work.

A common designer’s project folder:

I rarely recall to switch on sorting by date. And sharing a project on a flash drive with a colleague will remove all soring by date and files will be in a mess. 

To save time and keep project organised name all files in date format Year-month-day. My current project folder:

<span class="p800">![map](/blog_img/advices/organized_files.png)</span>

I name files at the end of the day. To avoid typing date manually I use <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/eabf46psk6fi8nz/current_date.workflow.zip?dl=0" target="_blank">action from Automator</a>. It adds the current date to selected file or folder.
