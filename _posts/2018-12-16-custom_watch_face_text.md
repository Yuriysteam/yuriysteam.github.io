I load my notes with collected from the internet texts. Last month I read about Japanese technique howt to reach goals. One can create a kotodama (言霊) – an idea pressed in five-six words how you want your future to be.

Kotodama worked for my projects and life goals. Of course, I have a desire to be reminded about it. Calendar notifications are too distracting. On the other side, I am too lazy to open a note: open note app, find it, read it... Horrible experience. 

I found a better way to remind myself by using Watch Faces. I made a Photoshop template with layout and set up texts. After I put images to an album in Photos.app and set up syncing.

If you need to add a custom reminder or memo download [Photoshop template](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ly4oqkvsfeb5l5l/apple_watch_text_complication.psd?dl=0).
