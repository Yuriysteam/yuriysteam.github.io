In Japanese culture believed that words have power. To reach the goal, one can create a Kotodama (言霊). In my practice, it worked with projects and life goals. I found the best way remind myself by using Watch Faces. 

Instead of buying an app I created a Photoshop template with a simple layout and set up texts. Then I put images to album in Photos.app and set up syncing.

If you need to put custom reminder or memo download [Photoshop template](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ly4oqkvsfeb5l5l/apple_watch_text_complication.psd?dl=0).
