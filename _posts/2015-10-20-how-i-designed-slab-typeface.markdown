Hi, my name is Yuriy, and welcome to a new series of posts about typography and typeface design. I am a graphic design student with a couple years of experience in the field.

I always wanted to try typeface design. When I got a task of free choice in school, the decision of making a font was clear. This is a very challenging process and it will take a lot of effort, skill and organisation. To help me with that, I will have some help from my two mentors.

This is a weekly series about how I create letters and shape them into a harmonies font. It means, that every week there will be a post about my mistakes, corrections, tips and workflow. As well, I am greatly welcome to your comments and tips. 

### Week 1: Goals, tools and research

Every design project starts with a goal.

**The goal is:** create a modern slab typeface for big formats (ad, billboards, posters) (lowercase and uppercase) with a flavour of Finland.

With the goal defined I go to a research part. The best place to start is to look closely at other typefaces. For instance good examples can be:

- Aleo
- Amazing Grotesk
- Bitter
- Klinik Slab
- Lubalin Graph
- Merriweather
- Muse Slab
- Slaberlin

And as well I look at some Scandinavian graphic design, Scandinavian type design, Scandinavian architectural design and Finnish/Swedish nature.

As for the tools: I am using [Glyphs app](https://glyphsapp.com) (which has a students discounts) to convert vector to the font file, Adobe Illustrator to make vector shapes and some occasional sketching with a pencil.

With a typeface, like with identity design, there must be a system of rules and regularities. For instance the shape of serifs, shape of dots or height of glyphs (x-height).

> My mentor suggested starting designing glyphs following the order from the word “videospan”. The reason is simple: “v” gives you an idea about what will be the x-height, how serifs will look like. Then "d" and “p” tell what the height for ascenders and descender. Next “e” and “o” describe overshot for lowercase. Some of these letters can help to make other glyphs. For instance: “n” and “m” and “u” have a lot of similarities. As well as pairs “p” - “d” and “q” - “b”.
 
###First letter

I started with defining a shape of lowercase “a”. Because there are two options (double-storey a and single-storey ɑ) I had a choice which one to choose. As well, “a” can define, which type of serif I like to use.

I have a preference for double-storey a and serif, which is close to block rectangle shape with a slight cut on the side.

With sketching and looking at other typefaces and Finnish woods pictures, I found an interesting solution for a's bowl (a geometric rough and straight lines with some natural and soft curves). This idea of combining something raw, rude with natural and soft will define the rest of the shapes.

I refined the letter in the Illustrator with some additional twicks and help of the vector tools. For now I am not worrying to much about stroke thikness, but I am aware of that.

As well on Friday I had a couple more character basied on a same logic, so I put them all together. I have very different strokes on “a” and “b” comparing to the rest characters. This will be sort out later.

###To be continued...

Thank you for reading this first post. Please share my experience with others. If you have some comments, suggestions and tips you are welcome to tweet me at [@yuriysteam](www.twitter.com/yuriysteam). 

*Because right now I am on a 3ed week of this project, I will try to post the 2nd week a bit ahead to make the process live. Expect to get new post every week between Thursday and Friday.*
