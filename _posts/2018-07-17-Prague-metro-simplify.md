Czech Republic is a country of traditions. Especially with their metro map. Well... traditions be damned! It appeared the solution to a convenient map is in a different direction. 

I had tried approaches around the idea of keeping the shape of current metro lines and just readjust stylistics.

Different central solutions.

Yesterday in Artem's Gorbunov Bureau Ilya Birman [was giving](https://bureau.ru/bb/soviet/20180717/) a video comment about the scheme of Prague's metro.

Taking into consideration some of the feedback. First attempt:

<span class="p800">![map](/blog_img/metro/strait-v1.png)</span>

Red line and ends of green and yellow vertical? Sure

<span class="p800">![map](/blog_img/metro/strait-v3.png)</span>

Warmer! Triangle and diagonal lines are out of balance with the whole scheme. Straighten them out too. 

<span class="p800">![map](/blog_img/metro/strait-v4.png)</span>

Small details: adding balance to names, lines with the grid, changing colours and fixing airport transfer. The map is clean. Geography is ignored for stations after the centre. Tourists will not need the information about the geographical landscape anyway. 

<span class="p800">![map](/blog_img/metro/map-prague-metro-v0.1.png)</span>

After internal debate decided that lines need to be marked with letters.

<span class="p800">![map](/blog_img/metro/map-prague-metro-v0.2.png)</span>

Metro navigation uses A, B, C letters on signs to help find the right station or entrance. And traditionally, citizens of Prague say A line or B line, instead of colour.

More out of curiosity: navigation signs for stations. German style arrows with cardinal and station directions.
