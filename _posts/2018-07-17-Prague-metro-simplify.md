Czech Republic is a  traditional country. Especially with their metro map. Well, traditions be damned. It appeared that the solution to making a convenient map was in a different direction. 

I had tried several approaches all around the same idea: trying to keep the shape of current metro lines and just readjust stylistics.

Made different central solutions.

Yesterday in Artem's Gorbunov Bureau advice page was published an advice about scheme of Prague's metro. Ilya Birman [was giving](https://bureau.ru/bb/soviet/20180717/) a video comment about it.

Taking into consideration some of the feedback. First attempt:

More!

What about making red line and ends of green and yellow vertical?

<span class="p800">![map](/blog_img/metro/strait-v3.png)</span>

Warmer! Triangle and diagonal lines are out of balance with the whole scheme. Straighten them out too. 

<span class="p800">![map](/blog_img/metro/strait-v4.png)</span>

Small details: adding balance to names, lines with the grid, changing colours and fixing airport transfer. The map is clean. Geography is ignored for stations after the centre. Tourists will not need the information about the geographical landscape anyway. 

<span class="p800">![map](/blog_img/metro/map-prague-metro-v0.1.png)</span>

After internal debate decided that lines need to be marked with letters.

<span class="p800">![map](/blog_img/metro/map-prague-metro-v0.2.png)</span>

Because metro navigation uses A, B, C letters on signs to help to the right line. As well, traditionally, citizens of Prague say A line or B line, instead of colour.

More out of curiosity: navigation signs for stations. German style arrows with cardinal and station directions.
