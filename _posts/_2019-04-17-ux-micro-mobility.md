Micro-mobility gaining popularity because it’s faster than car-based trips. Sometimes even faster a public transportation. In my opinion scooters and bikes will not change transportation in the cities, but will be a solid addition to current means. To have a better experince in the future I propose a set of ideas for scooters and sharing services.

### LED stripe displays charge level

<span class="p1000">![Micro mobility scooters charging levels](/projects_img/scooter/charge.jpg)</span>

When it comes to finding a suitable scooter for a ride — battery charge is the most important criteria. It's a bummer to find a pool of scooters, open the app, tap on every vehicle and find out that all of them have a dead battery. There are no visual indicators on scooters to let you know they’re out of commission. I propose to use an LED stripe to show charge level.

An LED stripe can be a part of a headlights.

[Bird](https://www.bird.co/zero/) and [Lime](https://www.li.me/second-street/lime-s-gen-3-electric-scooter-transform-micro-mobility) already preparing a next generation of vehicles to be more durable and long lasting. LED can be a convenient modification for next generation of public scooters.

### AR to show charge levels

LED stripe with charge level is a technical improvement. Augmented Reality (AR) can be a software improvement to solve discoverability and low battery problem. Unfortunately, GPS only solution will not be accurate. With [software enchantments](https://eng.uber.com/rethinking-gps/), mobile internet and Bluetooth — positioning of a single vehicle can be accurate up to 2 meters.

### Vehicle unlock with NFC

Taking a picture of QR or type a digit code is slow. For now, Apple is reserved to open NFC chip to third-party developers. I believe this will change with time.

### No screen

Considering NFC unlocking, charge level in the app or with LED stripe — the scooter of the future will not need a display. Currently, it shows speed and how much charge left. In the future, it will indicate parking zones.

All of this can be displayed in the app with the map. Less screens and technology on the scooter – cheaper and more durable it can be.

### Integration with maps

<span class="p700">![Micro mobility scooters charging levels](/projects_img/scooter/map.jpg)</span>

Scooters or e-bikes will make a good addition to city transport. Map integration solves discoverability, charge and parking questions.

For riders with set destination map service collects charge and location data from scooters, combine it with allowed parking zones, bike lanes and terrain and build an optimal route. Based on this information map service can offer a nearby scooter, estimate the price and provide the best ride.

Scooters will be a part of our day to day commute. It will take time, effort, regulations and new design solutions to bring them to public. I have [designed experince](desing/2019/04/16/scooter-sharing-watch-app.html) for renting scooters on Apple Watch. I belive, in the future it will help to provide a smoother and enjoyable ride experience.
