Beauty is not visible and lay on the surface. To create beauty it requires the skill of observation, noticing and imagination before the beauty is created.

Professionals like hairdressers and stylists have an eye on how to bring the most charming characters of humans and make them more beautiful.

Illustrators, Instagrammers, photographers and painters notice beauty in nature, architecture and world around us. 

The moviemakers, writers make stories with a beautiful life and set of events.

Designers, architects and developers imagine beautiful products, buildings, furniture and objects before they exist and bring them to reality.

All of those people share an amazing skill – they can see the beauty before it’s created.
