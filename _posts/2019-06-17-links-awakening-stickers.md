A week ago I published a sticker pack to celebrate Link's Awakening on Nintendo Switch. 

<span class="p1000">![link's awakening telegram stickers](/projects_img/stickers/link-cover.png)</span>

The work had a friendly reception. In one week more than **110 installs** and more than **200 times used** on Telegram. It made to the hot list of [r/zelda](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/c124up/lahd_cute_links_awakening_emoji/) on reddit.

For the future is to share the pack for discor community and for iMessage.
