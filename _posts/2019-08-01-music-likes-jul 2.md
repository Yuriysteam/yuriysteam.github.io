I started a new job, travelled to Germany by car for 700km and discovered Korean shows. In July's collection: driving indie rock, Korean and Geman songs and some good oldies. Check out *Bump of Chicken*, *Monoliths by Maserati,* *Jarum* and *Get Yourself Together by Black Keys*.

[Enjoy the collection](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4r8DwwofUXmOO5alou1wfR?si=H4B0_QXYT32KDt4pV8DPvQ) on Spotify. Suitable for a commute or travelling onÂ foot. For Apple Music use [Convertify](https://haydenhong.com/convertify/) to get the playlist.
