Tables are not always the best way to represent information. For retail they can mislead and confuse.

The goal of a table help search and compare data. With care we can tell a story with data: show best price, show growth or decline or display the change. 

Before start reformatting, I think about scenario where or when this table might be used. Why does the user will need it?

### When table is the only choice

Provide some care and show what is important in your table. For example give the main changes of values. Provide time periods or locations.



[example]



Remove unnecessary clatter.



[example]



Headline is helping to set up theme and explain content of the table. Headline should be short, capacious and explanatory. 



[example]



Repetitive data recommended to put in the headline. Also, sorting of line should help with readability. And alphabetical or numerical order might be not the best.



By default text is aligned in top left corner. Digits can be aligned to the right. If digits contains dot separator, all numbers aligned based on this dot. 



[example]



Delete unnecessary words

### Table for mobile

Personally I don’t like horizontal scroll. Vertical one is better, faster and users are used to it. With care and reformation tables full of data can be suitable for phone and table screens.
